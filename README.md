###############
This proposes and designs a multi-metric and multi-module sub-image voting algorithm for rapid detection of periodic texture defects. 
By using the Faster RCNN model under PyTorch framework and Halcon algorithm, the Halcon operator of the algorithm is written independently, 
which solves the problem of automatic detection of defects on the surface of industrial periodic texture fabrics.
